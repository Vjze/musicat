Note: musicat is currently in major version zero (0.x) active development, and features are being added regularly. Things may break or change at any time! Keep an eye out for new releases, report bugs and give feedback! 

## Features
- Music player with support for MP3, FLAC, WAV, AAC, OGG
- Albums view
- Mini-player and oscilloscope visualizer
- Sorting releases chronologically within artist sort (discography sort)
- Toggle library view between lossy/lossless/both
- Edit file metadata including embedded artwork
- Use Smart Query to create smart auto-updating playlists based on rules eg. "tracks that contains 'love' released after 1950, longer than 4 mins"

### For musicians
- Keep your messy ideas in the Scrapbook - audio/video clips, text files, links, etc. Tag them and easily find them later.
- Manage your music in the Artist's toolkit
  - Manage your artists and musical projects
  - Create song entries, add info and lyrics
  - Attach files (or drag from the scrapbook), from cool riffs to final masters.
- Look up chords/lyrics in DuckDuckGo, go to artist on Wikipedia
