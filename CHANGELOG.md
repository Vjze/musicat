🏗️ To-be-released

- Artist's toolkit, a way for musicians to manage a library of original music, as well as write lyrics, attach media (ideas, snippets) for songs that are in progress. I'll be sharing more about this soon! 
- Create powerful smart queries to find exactly what you're looking for. Example: "by Charlie Parker" and "title include 'love'" "released between 1952 and 1967". Smart queries can be saved for later use. Initially we have some simple conditions, but later on the list of condition blocks will include more complex queries. 
- Faster importing tracks for bigger libraries. 


📦 0.2.0 "Very meta"

- Right-click on track -> "Info & metadata" to view and edit the metadata tags from the source file.
- You can update any existing tag, add or replace an image encoded in the file.

📦 0.1.1 "Search and you shall find, maybe"

- Search for tracks in the sidebar! Or press Cmd/Ctr + F. 
- Note: this only works for tracks/artists/albums that "start with" the query (words in the middle don't match, yet)
